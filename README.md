DEEP FASHION

Can a machine imitate the mind of a fashion shopper?

When an e-commerce user views the image of a fashion apparel, her mind (yes mind, not brain) goes through a complex decision making process. This leads to the decision on whether to buy or pass on the object. Can a neural network imitate this decision making process?

Can you predict the sales of fashion apparel based on the photograph of the apparel? This is a machine learning project. It is a Java project that uses DL4J neural networks. This project has the code to fetch, clean and create the dataset from a relational database. 

This product is intended for Business Intelligence software. It uses convolutional neural networks to "look" at images of products and corresponding historical sales data.
